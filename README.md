Key Features:
Goal Definition and Prioritization:

Users can input up to 3-5 top goals (e.g., fitness, learning a new skill, studying).
The app asks for the target completion time or frequency (daily, weekly, or by a specific date) and breaks down bigger goals into smaller, manageable tasks.
Smart Time-Slot Finder:

The app scans the user’s existing schedule to find gaps or free time.
Based on time available and the priority of the goals, it suggests the optimal time slots for working on each task.
Users can adjust the suggested time slots based on their preferences (morning/night people, etc.).
Adaptive Frequency and Progress Tracker:

The app determines how often each task should be repeated or worked on to ensure steady progress.
Tracks progress towards the goal with easy-to-understand visuals like percentage bars, milestones, and “projected completion dates” based on how often users engage with the tasks.
If users miss a scheduled session, the app reschedules it intelligently, avoiding overloading the calendar.
Habit Formation and Reminders:

Sends reminders based on the user's behavior and habits. It learns over time when users are most productive or likely to skip, adjusting reminders accordingly.
Integrates motivational prompts or reminders to keep users on track, like “You’ve only got 3 sessions left this week to hit your fitness goal!”
Free-Time Finder:

It can analyze the user's daily patterns to find consistent windows of free time.
The app suggests ways to fit in small tasks or activities during shorter breaks (like quick reading or meditation in a 15-minute window).
Analytics and Insights:

Provides feedback on how the user is progressing. For example, it can show how much time was spent on each goal over a week and suggest adjustments to stay balanced or meet deadlines.
Could eventually include AI that learns from user patterns and gives personalized recommendations on optimizing time use and avoiding burnout.
